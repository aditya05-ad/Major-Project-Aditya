1. ABSTRACT

This project implements a simple Cricket Scoreboard System using the C programming language. The program allows the user to enter details of a cricket team, including team name, number of players, and each player’s batting performance. For every player, the runs scored, balls faced, number of fours, sixes, and strike rate are calculated and displayed in a formatted scoreboard.

The system also computes the team’s total runs, total wickets lost, and total overs faced based on the total number of balls. It demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, loops, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations in C. This project is suitable for beginners who want to understand how to model real-world problems, like sports scoring, using structured programming.


2. OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to design a console-based cricket scoreboard application that:
•	Accepts team-level and player-level input from the user.
•	Calculates and displays individual player statistics, such as runs, balls faced, number of boundaries, and strike rate.
•	Calculates and displays team totals, including total runs, total wickets, and overs.
•	Demonstrates how to use structures and arrays to store related data in C.
•	Provides a clear, readable tabular scoreboard output.
Through this project, the aim is to apply C programming concepts to a simple sports-based application and improve understanding of data structuring and formatted output.


3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
In many small matches, practice sessions, or school/college-level games, cricket scores are often written manually on paper. This has several limitations:
•	Calculating strike rate and overs manually for each player is time-consuming.
•	There is a chance of calculation mistakes in totals and averages.
•	Data is not presented in a clean, structured format for easy understanding.
Problem:
There is a need for a basic computerized tool that can help students or scorers enter batting data for a team and automatically calculate and display a neat scoreboard with correct statistics.
Solution:
This C program solves the problem by allowing the user to input each player’s performance and automatically generating a complete scoreboard. It calculates strike rate for each player, total team runs, total wickets, and overs, and then prints all details in a well-organized manner.



4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND ALGORITHM

The system follows a modular architecture as required by the project guidelines:

File Structure:

“src/main.c” controls program flow and user interaction.
“src/scoreboard.c” handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update/Delete) operations.
“src/utils.c” provides helper functions (like clearing the screen).
“include/scoreboard.h” Contains structure definitions and function prototypes.

Algorithm Example: Adding team detail

Start program.
Read team name using fgets().
Prompt user to enter total number of players (maximum 11).
Ask user to enter total wickets lost.
Convert total balls to overs = totalBalls / 6.0.
Display formatted scoreboard:
•	Team name
•	Total score with wickets and overs
•	Table of player statistics
End program.


5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The program is implemented in C using GCC. Structures are used to store player and team data, loops handle repeated user input for multiple players, a conditional block calculates the strike rate to avoid division errors, and formatted output is used to generate a clean scoreboard. The implementation demonstrates structured programming through the use of data models, arithmetic operations, and organized display formatting.
Key Language Features Used:
File Streams: Used FILE * pointers to manage data persistence.
Standard I/O: Used printf and scanf for the user interface.
Header Files: Created scoreboard.h to share definitions across .c files.


6. TESTING AND RESULTS

The system was tested with various inputs to ensure stability and correctness.

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

Cricket Scoreboard System developed in C successfully collects and displays detailed batting statistics for a cricket team. Using structures and arrays, it organizes the data of multiple players and provides a clear, formatted scoreboard that includes total runs, wickets, overs, and individual performance metrics like strike rate.

The project meets its objectives of applying C programming concepts to a real-world-style application, improving understanding of data structuring, loops, conditional logic, and formatted output.

Future Scope:

The current version of the program can be further enhanced in several ways:
•	Support for Two Teams: Extend the program to handle both Team A and Team B, and display match results (who won, by how many runs/wickets).
•	Bowling Statistics: Add another structure for bowlers to store overs bowled, runs conceded, wickets taken, and economy rate.
•	File Storage: Use file handling to save scoreboards to a text file so that match records can be stored and viewed later.
•	Input Validation: Add checks to ensure that runs, balls, and wickets are within valid ranges.
•	User-Friendly Menu: Convert the program into a fully menu-driven system with options like “Enter Team Details”, “Show Scoreboard”, “Exit”.
•	Graphical Interface: In the future, the logic can be reused in a graphical application for better presentation.
